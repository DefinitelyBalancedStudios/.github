# 🎮 Definitely Balanced Studios

> *"All our games ship perfectly balanced... until you play them."*

## 🧙 Who We Are
We’re a tiny indie game studio dedicated to:
- Making **RPGs** that feel epic, chaotic, and sometimes *a little cursed*.
- Building worlds where **loot is plentiful**, **walls are destructible**, and **balance is more of a suggestion**.
- Learning Unity together, one bug at a time.

## ⚔️ What We're Working On
- **March of the Titans** (codename)  
  A spiritual successor to Warcraft III custom maps like *The Black Road*, with:
  - Sanctums to defend 🏰
  - Titans to topple 👑
  - NPC allies who *definitely* won’t die permanently (oops)  
  - Crafting, chaos, and a *“totally fair”* difficulty curve™

## 🐉 Our Design Philosophy
1. **If it’s broken, it’s a feature.**
2. **Balance is overrated.**
3. **The wall always falls.**
4. **Permadeath makes friends more valuable… right?**
